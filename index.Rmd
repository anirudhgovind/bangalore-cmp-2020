# I want the home screen to contain an interactive map of Bangalore which shows all the projects proposed in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Bengaluru 2020. The map needs to have relevant boundaries (BBMP Ward, BMRDA) in addition to the projects. Also, projects will need to be categorized to make it easier to understand.

# First, I will set up a base map with the BBMP ward boundaries.

bangaloreWardBoundary <- read_sf(here::here("data/raw-data/bangaloreWardBoundary.shp"))

# Transform it for consistency

bangaloreWardBoundary <- bangaloreWardBoundary %>% 
  st_transform(3857)

# Draw the map

tm_shape(bangaloreWardBoundary) +
  tm_borders(col = "#000000",
             lwd = 2)
```
