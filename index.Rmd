# I want the home screen to contain an interactive map of Bangalore which shows all the projects proposed in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Bengaluru 2020. The map needs to have relevant boundaries (BBMP Ward, BMRDA) in addition to the projects. Also, projects will need to be categorized to make it easier to understand.

# First, I will set up a base map with the BBMP ward boundaries.

bangaloreWardBoundary <- read_sf(here::here("data/raw-data/bangaloreWardBoundary.shp"))

# Now load in the dataset for this map. To start with, its going to have just points.

bangaloreCMPProjects <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("data/raw-data/bangaloreCMP2020Projetcs.xlsx"))

# Okay. I tried working with all projects in one DF but its makes sense to split them by project type. Then I can make the pop-up info more useful.
