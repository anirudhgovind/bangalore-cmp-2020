# I want the home screen to contain an interactive map of Bangalore which shows all the projects proposed in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Bengaluru 2020. The map needs to have relevant boundaries (BBMP Ward, BMRDA) in addition to the projects. Also, projects will need to be categorized to make it easier to understand.

# Now load in the dataset for this map. To start with, its going to have just points.

bangaloreCMPProjects <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("data/raw-data/bangaloreCMP2020Projects.xlsx"))

# Okay. I tried working with all projects in one DF but its makes sense to split them by project type. Then I can make the pop-up info more useful.

# Filter out the locations that are not geo-located yet

  filter(!is.na(location)) %>% 
  separate(location, sep = ", ", into = c("lon", "lat"))

# BASE MAP

# The CMP 2020 defines the study area as the whole of Bengaluru Metropolitan Area (1294.00 Sq.Km), part of Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor Area (79.14 Sq.Km) and a part of Bangalore International Airport Area Local Planning Authority (227.85 Sq.Km). BUT, I don't see a map which explicitly shows these areas. :/ 

# Till I figure that out, I'll show the BBMP and metropolitan area boundaries.

# First, I will set up a base map with the BBMP ward boundaries.
